# AES-128-bit---Encryption
Software Implementation of the encryption algorithm using python 2.7.12
This repository includes my project work with every module implementation seperately.
Description about all code files as below:
1. Project 2_JMD_ARK - This file includes the python implementation of Add-Round key step of AES encryption.
2. Project 2_JMD_BS - This file contains code for Byte-substitution step of AES Implementation.
3. Project 2_JMD_KS - The file contains the code for the step called Key Schedule of AES.
4. Project 2_JMD_MC - .py file includes the code for Mix-Column step of python implementation.
5. Project 2_JMD_SR - It is the code for Shift-Row step of AES.
6. Project 2_JMD_Final_modified AES - The code is for modified implementation of AES, where The the row number 4 and 5 of SBox were interchanged.

Note: All code are accepting Input of 32 hex numbers (128 bit) i.e. 1a0c24f2875493bcb7080e43930f5683 as key and as Plain Data
